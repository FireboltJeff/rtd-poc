# Query history

The `query_history` view can be used to explore Firebolt's query history in your account.\
The view is available in all databases and can be queried, for example, as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    catalog.query_history 
LIMIT 100;
```

The `query_history` view contains the following columns:
