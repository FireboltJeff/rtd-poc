# Information schema & usage views

The Firebolt [information schema](./#information-schema-views) consists of a set of system views that contains metadata information on the objects defined in the current database. In addition, it contains a set of [database usage](./#account-usage-views) \(catalog\) views such as the [query history](query-history-view.md) and [running queries](running-queries.md) views.


Firebolt information schema relies on the standard SQL information schema with some additional information and views that are FIrebolt specific.
