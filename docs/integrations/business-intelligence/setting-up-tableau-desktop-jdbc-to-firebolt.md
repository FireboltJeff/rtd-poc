# Connecting to Tableau (Desktop)

This topic describes the steps for setting up the Tableau (Desktop) connection to Firebolt.

## Step 1: Install the latest Firebolt JDBC Driver

Download Firebolt’s JDBC driver for Tableau from [here](../connecting-via-jdbc.md).

Put the JDBC jar file in the Tableau JDBC driver folder:

* Windows: `C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers`
* Mac: `~/Library/Tableau/Drivers`

## Step 2: Install the latest Firebolt TACO file

Download Firebolt’s packaged connector file for Tableau (with a .taco filename extension) from [here](https://firebolt-publishing-public.s3.amazonaws.com/repo/Tableau/firebolt\_connector.taco).

Copy the packaged connector file into your `My Tableau Repository/Connectors directory`:

* Windows:_`C:\Users\[your-user]\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Connectors`_
* Mac:_`~/Documents/My Tableau Repository/Connectors`_

## Step 3: Set up the connection to Firebolt in Tableau

### Pre-requisites

1. Make a note of the database name you would like to connect to in Firebolt. Also, make sure the database has an up-and-running engine before you configure the connection in Tableau.
2. Make a note of the username and password used to log into Firebolt.
3. Start Tableau and disable the signature validation for the TACO file - read more in [Tableau's docs](https://tableau.github.io/connector-plugin-sdk/docs/run-taco) under the "Disabling signature verification" topic.

### Configuring the Connection
